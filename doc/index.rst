Introduction
````````````
The ULTRA Detector System enables capture of one dimensional spectra at extremely high rates.
Where CCDs were used to capture a line of data at a time, the ULTRA Detector System offers many orders of
magnitude faster time framing. ULTRA is a compact turnkey system. The data acquisition system is attached
in a compact form factor unit with gigabit Ethernet out and multiple I/O options onboard.

Ultra Specification:-

Sustained Spectral Rate 20 KHz (spectra per second) Maximum
Frame Period            <500 ns Minimum
Spectral Sensitivity    5 – 17KeV 300µm thickness. 500µm also available.
Output                  Gigabit Ethernet
Pixel configuration     Si 512 linear strips @ 50µm pitch
ADC Dynamic Range       16 Bit
Synchronisation Inputs  TTL or Fibre Optic
Integration Time        <1us - 650us frames
TriggeringExternal      (TTL or Fibre) or Internal (10KHz fixed)



Prerequisite
````````````

The default network setup is (excluding the site network connection):

1GBit Copper network for control communinication between the PC and the Ultra box.
 

Installation & Module configuration
````````````````````````````````````

-  follow first the steps for the linux installation :ref:`linux_installation`

The minimum configuration file is *config.inc* :

.. code-block:: sh

  COMPILE_CORE=1
  COMPILE_SIMULATOR=0
  COMPILE_SPS_IMAGE=1
  COMPILE_ULTRA=1
  export COMPILE_CORE COMPILE_SPS_IMAGE COMPILE_SIMULATOR COMPILE_ULTRA

-  start the compilation :ref:`linux_compilation`

-  finally for the Tango server installation :ref:`tango_installation`

Initialisation and Capabilities
````````````````````````````````
In order to help people to understand how the camera plugin has been implemented in LImA this section
provide some important information about the developer's choices.

Camera initialisation
......................

The camera will be initialized within the UltraCamera object. A TCP and UDP socket connections on the 1GBit port are established

The Ultra requires the following parameters with the recommended settings.
headname          = 192.168.1.100
hostname          = 192.168.1.103
tcpPort           = 7
udpPort           = 5005
npixels           = 512

Std capabilites
................

This plugin has been implemented with respect of the mandatory capabilites but with some limitations which
are due to the camera.  We only provide here extra information for a better understanding
of the capabilities for Ultra cameras.

* HwDetInfo
  
  getCurrImageType/getDefImageType(): is set to Bpp16

* HwSync

  get/setTrigMode(): the only supported modes are IntTrig, ExtTrigMult and IntTrigMult
  

Optional capabilities
